## About Me

I am a second-year Operations Research PhD student at Stanford University. I am broadly interested in Causal Inference, Large Language Model Evaluation, Preference Learning, and Econometrics. I am advised by [Vasilis Syrgkanis](https://vsyrgkanis.com/) and am part of the [Stanford Causal AI Lab](https://scail.stanford.edu/).

Before starting my PhD, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, where I worked with [Gaurav Sinha](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/gauravsinha/) on problems related to online learning with large decision sets.

Prior to that, I spent two amazing years as an MTech research student at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore, where I was advised by [Prof. Siddharth Barman](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~barman/) and had the opportunity to collaborate with [Prof. Arindam Khan](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arindamkhan/). I worked on problems related to Multi-armed Bandits, Fairness, and Causal Inference.

Earlier in my career, I worked at Goldman Sachs Bangalore, where I built scalable analytics for fraud detection. I received my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from BITS Pilani.
