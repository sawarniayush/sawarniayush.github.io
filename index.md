## About Me

I am a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, where I work with [Gaurav Sinha](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/gauravsinha/) on problems related to online learning with large decision sets. 

Before joining MSR, I spent two amazing years as an MTech research student at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore, where I was advised by [Prof. Siddharth Barman](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~barman/). I also had the opportunity to collaborate with [Prof. Arindam Khan](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arindamkhan/). I worked on problems related to Multi-armed Bandits, Fairness, and Causal Inference.

Prior to my MTech, I worked at Goldman Sachs Bangalore, where I built scalable analytics for fraud detection. Before that, I obtained my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from BITS Pilani.

## Research Interests
