## About

I am a second-year Operations Research PhD student at Stanford University, advised by [Vasilis Syrgkanis](https://vsyrgkanis.com/) in the [Stanford Causal AI Lab](https://scail.stanford.edu/). My research focuses on algorithms for sequential decision making with an emphasis on causal inference and feedback from human participants.

Previously, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, working with [Gaurav Sinha](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/gauravsinha/) on large-decision-set online learning. I also completed an MTech research program at the Indian Institute of Science under the guidance of [Siddharth Barman](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~barman/) and [Arindam Khan](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arindamkhan/), and I built large-scale fraud analytics at Goldman Sachs in Bangalore. I hold a B.E. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from BITS Pilani.
