## About

I am a second-year Operations Research PhD student at Stanford University, advised by [Vasilis Syrgkanis](https://vsyrgkanis.com/) in the [Stanford Causal AI Lab](https://scail.stanford.edu/). My work sits at the intersection of causal inference, online learning, and human-centered algorithm design.

Before graduate school I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, working with [Gaurav Sinha](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/gauravsinha/) on online learning with large decision sets. I previously completed an MTech by research at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore with [Prof. Siddharth Barman](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~barman/) and [Prof. Arindam Khan](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arindamkhan/), where I studied multi-armed bandits, fairness, and causal inference. Earlier, at Goldman Sachs Bangalore, I built scalable analytics for fraud detection. I earned my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from BITS Pilani.

## Research interests

- Causal inference
- Online learning and bandit algorithms
- Preference elicitation and learning from human feedback
- LLM evaluation

## Open problems I am thinking about

- How to design adaptive experimentation pipelines that remain reliable under limited interventions.
- Learning from heterogeneous human feedback while providing strong welfare guarantees.
- Building evaluation methodologies for large language models that prioritize transparency and reproducibility.

## Service & community

I enjoy sharing work with broader research communities through talks and mentoring. Feel free to reach out if you would like to collaborate on open problems in online decision-making or causal inference.
